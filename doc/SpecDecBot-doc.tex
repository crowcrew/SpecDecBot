\textit{`I Think Therefor I Am`,} is the standard when defining human intelligence, and by far any intelligence. However, so far the intelligence we've encountered doesn't only think, but also feels, Something that has guided our passion and exploded in various forms of creativity.\newline\newline
but with great passion comes risk, the risk to make rash decisions, rookie mistakes. pulling all-nighters at the office passionately trying to maximize the stock profits, or all those hours standing in the lab experimenting with life-saving medicinals and waiting for results, all that exhaustion puts your decisions at jeopardy.\newline\newline
Human Error, is by far the most fatal, because we trust our decision so much we're willing to stake everything on them, but what happens when you're under pressure but can't perform optimally?
\newline
You need something both capable of carrying your tasks and understanding them in layman terms, and something that is cryptographically secure.\newline\newline
For  that we present you dear user with SpecDecBot, an Artificial Agent capable of comprehending binary work-related questions using Natural Language Processing techniques and running them against specialty algorithms that perform optimally under all circumstances.

\begin{huge}{\textbf{Introduction}}\end{huge}\newline\newline
As illustrated in figure (0), the Project has an object-oriented work-flow, which goes as follows :\newline\newline
1)- an Input string is provided to a clever-bot.\newline
2)- the clever-bot utilizes an NLP class to mine a dictionary and create a semantic tree for the input string.\newline
3)- if the tree is successfully created, the bot uses the dictionary to link the tree with algorithms from the processes library.\newline
4)- the algorithms use input from the semantic tree and answer the intended question in a binary matter.\newline
5)- the bot uses the binary answer the NLP class, and the Dictionary to create a second semantic tree for an answer.\newline
6)- the bot converts the answer's semantic tree to an output-string.\newline
7)- in case the first semantic tree (the question's) is not created for reasons like "incomplete semantic tree, faulty input, or illogical input" or if the tree is incoherent, the clever-bot communicates with the user to try and correct the Error.\newline\newline
\textit{notice} : the Clever-Bot performs Semantic-Tree operations, String-Conversion and Algorithm-Linking operations.\newline
however, it can also communicate with the user in an interactive manner using suggestions from an embedded Chatter-Bot.
